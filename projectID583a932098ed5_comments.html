<HTML><BODY>William Lithgow (born around 1585 at Lanark, Scotland; died perhaps in 1645) was a traveler, writer and alleged spy. He claimed to have traveled 36,000 miles on foot. 

<p>Before 1610 he had visited Shetland, Switzerland, and Bohemia. In that year he set out from Paris for Rome, where he remained for four weeks before moving on to other parts of Italy: Naples, Ancona, Athens, Constantinople, and others. After a three-month stay in Constantinople, he sailed to other Greek localities and then on to Palestine, arriving in Jerusalemon Palm Sunday 1612, and later on to Egypt. His next journey, 1614–16, brought him to Tunis and Fez; but his last, 1619–21, to Spain, ended unfortunately in his apprehension at Malaga and torture as a spy.

<p>This 1906 reprint gives a first-hand report of his travels.

<p>Please do NOT modernize the original spelling, no matter how inconsistent, leave it as it is, but do indicate with [**notes] things that are likely typo's.

<p>Have fun!
